## Task Details

### Task 1: Create shared workout interfaces file ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**File**: `src/types/workout.ts`  
**Description**: Create shared TypeScript interfaces for workout-related types to ensure consistency across components.

**Requirements**:
- Create `WorkoutSet` interface with reps, weight, completed properties
- Create `WorkoutExercise` interface with id, name, sets, primaryMuscles, secondaryMuscles, restTime
- Create `EditField` type union for 'reps' | 'weight'
- Export all interfaces for use across components

**Code Template**:
```typescript
export interface WorkoutSet {
  reps: number;
  weight: number;
  completed: boolean;
}

export type EditField = 'reps' | 'weight';

export interface WorkoutExercise {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  sets: WorkoutSet[];
  primaryMuscles: string[];
  secondaryMuscles?: string[];
  restTime: number;
}
```

### Task 2: Update ExerciseCard component with type safety improvements ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Files**: `src/components/ExerciseCard.tsx`  
**Description**: Replace any types with proper TypeScript interfaces and improve type safety.

**Requirements**:
- Import shared workout types from Task 1
- Update ExerciseCardProps interface to use WorkoutExercise and EditField types
- Replace any generic types with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Add proper typing for all callback functions

**Key Changes**:
- Update exercise prop type from `any` to `WorkoutExercise`
- Update onSetEdit field parameter from `'reps' | 'weight'` to `EditField`
- Add proper typing for all event handlers

---

### Task 3: Add accessibility enhancements to ExerciseCard component ❌
**Status**: Pending  
**Files**: `src/components/ExerciseCard.tsx`  
**Description**: Enhance accessibility with ARIA labels, screen reader support, and keyboard navigation.

**Requirements**:
- Add aria-label attributes to all interactive buttons
- Add aria-pressed for set completion buttons
- Include visually-hidden text for screen reader context
- Add proper focus management
- Ensure all icons have aria-hidden="true"

**Key Accessibility Features**:
- Set completion buttons: aria-label with current state and action
- Edit buttons: aria-label with current value and purpose
- Menu buttons: aria-label for context
- Screen reader announcements for set completion status

---

### Task 4: Implement React.memo and performance optimizations ❌
**Status**: Pending  
**Files**: `src/components/ExerciseCard.tsx`  
**Description**: Add performance optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

**Requirements**:
- Wrap component export with React.memo
- Implement useCallback for all event handler functions
- Optimize prop dependencies to minimize re-renders
- Maintain component functionality while improving performance

**Key Optimizations**:
- React.memo wrapper for component
- useCallback for handleSetComplete, handleSetEdit, handleSetMenu, handleAddSet
- Proper dependency arrays for callbacks

---

### Task 5: Add muscle group display to ExerciseCard component ❌
**Status**: Pending  
**Files**: `src/components/ExerciseCard.tsx`  
**Description**: Move muscle group display from Workout component to ExerciseCard for better encapsulation.

**Requirements**:
- Add muscle group chips display in card header
- Use IonChip components with proper styling
- Display primary muscles as chips
- Maintain consistent styling with app theme

**Implementation**:
- Add muscle groups section in IonCardHeader
- Map through primaryMuscles array to create chips
- Apply consistent styling with existing muscle chip classes

---

### Task 6: Update ExerciseCard CSS with responsive improvements ❌
**Status**: Pending  
**Files**: `src/components/ExerciseCard.css`  
**Description**: Enhance CSS with responsive design, accessibility features, and improved mobile experience.

**Requirements**:
- Add muscle group styling for new chip display
- Enhance focus-visible styles for accessibility
- Add responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
- Improve button sizing and spacing for touch interaction
- Add visually-hidden class for screen reader text

**Key CSS Enhancements**:
- `.muscle-groups` and `.muscle-chip` styles
- Enhanced focus-visible styles for all buttons
- Responsive breakpoints for 480px and 350px screens
- `.visually-hidden` utility class for accessibility

---

### Task 7: Update Workout component to use new types and ExerciseCard props ❌
**Status**: Pending  
**Files**: `src/pages/Workout.tsx`  
**Description**: Update Workout component to use new shared types and pass additional props to ExerciseCard.

**Requirements**:
- Import shared workout types
- Update exercises state typing from `any[]` to `WorkoutExercise[]`
- Update editingSet state to use EditField type
- Add isWorkoutActive prop to ExerciseCard usage
- Update handleAddExerciseToWorkout to include secondaryMuscles

**Key Changes**:
- Replace `any[]` with `WorkoutExercise[]` for exercises state
- Update editingSet typing with EditField
- Pass isWorkoutActive={workoutStarted} to ExerciseCard
- Include secondaryMuscles in workout exercise creation

---

### Task 8: Create unit tests for ExerciseCard component ❌
**Status**: Pending  
**Files**: `src/components/ExerciseCard.test.tsx`  
**Description**: Create comprehensive unit tests using Vitest and React Testing Library.

**Requirements**:
- Test component rendering with mock data
- Test set completion functionality
- Test edit functionality for reps and weight
- Test add set functionality
- Test accessibility features
- Test disabled state when workout is inactive

**Test Coverage**:
- Exercise name and muscle group rendering
- Set display and completion status
- Button interactions and callback invocations
- Accessibility attributes and screen reader support
- Responsive behavior and edge cases

---

### Task 9: Run tests and verify all functionality works correctly ❌
**Status**: Pending  
**Description**: Execute comprehensive testing to ensure all enhancements work without breaking existing functionality.

**Requirements**:
- Run unit tests and ensure all pass
- Manual testing of enhanced features
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Verify accessibility with screen reader testing
- Performance testing to confirm optimization benefits

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Set completion works correctly
- [ ] Edit functionality for reps/weight works
- [ ] Add set functionality works
- [ ] Muscle groups display correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works properly
- [ ] Screen reader announces content correctly
- [ ] Performance improvements are measurable

## Notes and Considerations

### Performance Considerations
- React.memo will prevent re-renders when props haven't changed
- useCallback optimizations most beneficial with many exercise cards
- Monitor bundle size impact of additional type definitions

### Accessibility Standards
- Following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Focus on keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Maintaining semantic HTML structure with Ionic components

### Design System Integration
- Leveraging Ionic CSS variables for consistency
- Maintaining IronForge app design aesthetic
- Responsive design priorities mobile-first approach

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests focus on component functionality
- Manual testing for accessibility and responsive design
- Integration testing with parent Workout component
