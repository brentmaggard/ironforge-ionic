## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Component Structure
- **Dashboard Header**: IronForge header with app branding and user menu (Dashboard page only)
- **Tab Navigation**: Extracted bottom tab navigation for reusability
- **Page-based routing**: Clean separation of concerns with individual page components
- **Custom Page Headers**: Each page has its own appropriate header (Progress, Workout, modal pages)

### 2. Ionic Framework Standards
- **Always Use Ionic Components**: Prioritize native Ionic components (IonList, IonItem, IonButton, etc.) over HTML divs for proper mobile behavior and theming
- **Avoid Generic Divs**: Only use divs when Ionic components don't provide the needed layout pattern (e.g., flex containers for chips)
- **Component Hierarchy**: Follow Ionic's component structure guidelines for accessibility and consistent styling
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate Ionic components for their intended purpose (IonLabel for text, IonIcon for icons, etc.)

### 3. Styling Approach
- **Ionic CSS Variables**: Leveraged native Ionic theming system
- **Custom CSS Variables**: Added for consistent color theming
- **Mobile-first Design**: Responsive breakpoints prioritizing mobile experience
- **CSS Modules**: Page-specific styling with .css imports

### 4. Data Management
- **Mock Data**: Static data structures for prototyping and development
- **Component State**: React hooks for local component state management
- **Props Drilling**: Simple prop passing for current scope

### 5. UI/UX Patterns
- **Card-based Layout**: Consistent card design throughout the app
- **Swipeable Components**: Horizontal scrolling for progress metrics
- **Progress Indicators**: Circular and linear progress bars for visual feedback
- **Icon-driven Navigation**: Clear visual hierarchy with appropriate icons
- **Modal Overlays**: Profile page slides over main app content
- **Action Sheets**: Native mobile patterns for photo selection
- **Consistent Button Styling**: Unified circular button hover effects across all pages
- **Interactive Feedback**: Smooth transitions and hover states for all interactive elements

### 6. Progressive Web App (PWA) Architecture
- **Service Worker**: Automatic generation via Vite PWA plugin with Workbox
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache-first for fonts and static assets, runtime caching for dynamic content
- **Offline Support**: Custom offline page with IronForge branding and feature list
- **Install Prompts**: Cross-platform installation with custom iOS Safari instructions
- **App Manifest**: Comprehensive PWA manifest with proper icons and metadata
- **Theme Integration**: Native mobile browser theming with app color scheme

## Recent Updates (2025-08-28)

### Workout Page Timer and Header Controls Implementation
Following the header architecture refactor, the workout page was enhanced with a comprehensive timer system and professional header controls for workout management.

#### Timer System Development
- **Real-Time Timer Display**: Replaced static "Workout Builder" title with live timer in `00:00:00` format
- **Auto-Start Functionality**: Timer begins automatically when workout page opens using `useEffect` with `setInterval`
- **Pause/Resume Control**: Timer stops when paused, resumes seamlessly when unpaused
- **Persistent State Management**: React state management for `elapsedTime` and `isPaused` states
- **Smart Formatting**: Dynamic time formatting supporting hours, minutes, and seconds with proper zero-padding

#### Professional Header Controls
- **Pause/Resume Button**: Dynamic icon (pause ⏸️ when running, play ▶️ when paused) with white circular hover effects
- **Settings Gear**: IonActionSheet with workout-specific options (Rest Timer Settings, Auto Advance Sets, Sound & Notifications)
- **Complete Workout**: Green checkmark icon with matching green hover state (`rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.2)`)
- **Consistent Styling**: All header buttons follow unified 40px circular design with `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` hover states

#### Pause Overlay System
- **Professional Pause Screen**: Full-screen overlay matching reference design with black background and blur effects
- **Clean Typography**: "The workout is paused!" heading with proper spacing and timer display
- **Interactive Play Button**: Circular button with semi-transparent background, bold white border, and proper Ionic component structure
- **Responsive Layout**: Proper spacing hierarchy (5px between title/timer, 30px before play button)
- **Visual Polish**: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and proper centering with play icon alignment

#### Technical Implementation Details
- **Proper Ionic Structure**: Converted from generic `IonIcon` to proper `IonButton` + `IonIcon` pattern for accessibility
- **CSS Variables Integration**: Used Ionic CSS variables (`--color`, `--background`, `--border-color`) for consistent theming
- **State-Driven UI**: Timer effects controlled by `isPaused` dependency in useEffect
- **Component Architecture**: Clean separation between timer logic, UI state, and action handlers

#### User Experience Enhancements
- **Immediate Feedback**: Timer starts counting from page entry, providing instant workout duration awareness
- **Intuitive Controls**: Clear pause/resume functionality with visual state indicators
- **Professional Polish**: Settings access and workout completion options readily available
- **Consistent Branding**: Maintains IronForge design system with white-on-gradient theme throughout

#### Ionic Component Compliance Refactor
- **Generic Div Elimination**: Replaced inappropriate divs with semantic Ionic components following project architecture
- **Close Button Structure**: Removed wrapper div, simplified to direct `IonButton` + `IonIcon` structure
- **Exercise Details Layout**: Converted `<div className="exercise-details">` to proper `IonGrid`/`IonRow`/`IonCol` responsive structure
- **Pause Timer Display**: Changed from generic div to semantic `IonText` with proper heading hierarchy
- **Preserved Flex Containers**: Maintained acceptable divs for muscle-groups chips and custom overlays per architecture guidelines
- **CSS Cleanup**: Updated selectors and removed unnecessary styling for eliminated wrapper elements

#### Additional Workout Interface Enhancements

### Header Architecture Refactor
Following the workout management system implementation, the global header architecture was refactored to eliminate conflicts and provide each page with appropriate header functionality.

#### Problem Identification
- **Global Header Conflicts**: The centralized global header was interfering with custom page headers, particularly on the Workout page
- **Double Header Issues**: Progress page had both global header and its own IonHeader, creating visual clutter
- **Modal Page Independence**: Modal pages (Profile, Exercise, etc.) worked fine with their own headers but global header was unnecessary overhead
- **Layering Problems**: Global header z-index conflicts with custom workout functionality

#### Architecture Solution
- **Removed Global Header from App Structure**: Eliminated `<GlobalHeader />` from IonTabs in App.tsx
- **Dashboard-Specific Header**: Moved GlobalHeader component to Dashboard page only, preserving IronForge branding and menu functionality
- **Page-Specific Headers**: Each page now manages its own header independently without conflicts
- **Clean Separation**: Dashboard gets branded header, Progress gets simple header, Workout gets custom header

#### Implementation Details
- **App.tsx Changes**: Removed GlobalHeader import and usage from IonTabs structure
- **Dashboard.tsx Enhancement**: Added GlobalHeader as first element in IonPage for branded experience
- **Preserved Functionality**: Profile, Exercise Library, Install App, and Settings remain accessible via Dashboard header menu
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing navigation and functionality maintained

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Workout Page Liberation**: Custom workout header now operates without interference
- **Clean Progress Interface**: Simple "Progress" header without branding clutter
- **Consistent Dashboard Branding**: IronForge header maintains app identity on main page
- **Modal Page Independence**: Profile, Exercise, EditProfile pages retain their optimized custom headers

#### Technical Benefits
- **Eliminated Z-Index Conflicts**: No more layering issues between global and custom headers
- **Reduced Component Coupling**: Each page manages its own header requirements
- **Performance Optimization**: Header components only loaded where needed
- **Simplified Navigation Logic**: Clear separation of concerns between page types

This refactor demonstrates successful identification and resolution of architectural conflicts while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the overall user experience.
