# Native Mobile Integration & Capacitor

## Future Native Features

### Swipe-to-Close Modal Navigation
Implement swipe-right gesture to close modal pages using Ionic's Gestures API for native iOS/Android-like behavior on Exercise Library, Exercise Details, Profile, and Edit Profile pages.

### Push Notifications
Implement workout reminders and progress notifications using PWA notification APIs.

### Background Sync
Add background synchronization for workout data when connection is restored.

### Advanced PWA Features
- App shortcuts for quick workout access
- File handling for workout import/export
- Contact picker for sharing workout plans
- Web Share API for social features

## Capacitor Integration Planning

### Core Plugins
- **@capacitor/app**: App state and URL handling
- **@capacitor/camera**: Photo capture for profile images
- **@capacitor/local-notifications**: Workout reminders and rest timer alerts
- **@capacitor/preferences**: User settings and workout data persistence

### Platform-Specific Features
- **iOS**: Health Kit integration for fitness data sync
- **Android**: Google Fit integration and adaptive icons
- **Desktop**: File system access for workout data backup

### Implementation Strategy
1. Progressive enhancement from PWA base
2. Feature detection for native capabilities
3. Graceful fallbacks for web environment
4. Consistent API across platforms

## Native UI Patterns

### iOS-Specific
- Swipe gestures for modal dismissal
- Native action sheets and alerts
- Haptic feedback for set completion
- Safe area handling for notched devices

### Android-Specific
- Material Design transitions
- Bottom sheet patterns
- System navigation integration
- Adaptive icons and theming
