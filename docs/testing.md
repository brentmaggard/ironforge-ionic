# Testing & Development Standards

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Unit Tests
- **Vitest** + @testing-library/react for all components
- **MSW Integration**: Mock service worker for API testing and future backend integration
- **Performance Testing**: Loading time validation, skeleton timing, infinite scroll behavior
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader support, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation

### E2E Tests
- **Cypress** with mobile viewports (375x667 iPhone SE minimum)

## Performance Optimization Standards

### Long Lists
- Always implement IonSkeletonText + IonInfiniteScroll for lists >10 items
- **Loading States**: Realistic timing (800ms-1.5s) with professional animations
- **Pagination**: 20-item initial display, 20-item incremental loading
- **Mobile Performance**: Prevent rendering large datasets simultaneously on mobile devices

## Performance Testing & Virtualization Implementation

### Skeleton Loading System Enhancement
- **Exercise Library Optimization** - Enhanced existing skeleton loading with 5 comprehensive skeleton items including exercise name, completion badge, and muscle group placeholders
- **AddExercise Modal Enhancement** - Implemented 8 streamlined skeleton items with simplified layout matching the cleaner AddExercise interface design
- **Realistic Loading Simulation** - Exercise Library: 1.5s loading time, AddExercise: 800ms with modal state reset functionality
- **Professional Animation** - IonSkeletonText with animated property for smooth loading state transitions
- **Layout Preservation** - Skeleton items match real content dimensions preventing layout shifts during loading

### Infinite Scroll Virtualization
- **Exercise Library Implementation** - IonInfiniteScroll with 20-item initial display, 20-item incremental loading on scroll threshold
- **AddExercise Modal Integration** - Identical pagination pattern ensuring consistent user experience across exercise selection contexts
- **Performance Optimization** - Prevents rendering large exercise lists all at once, improving mobile performance
- **Threshold Management** - 100px scroll threshold with bubbles spinner and "Loading more exercises..." text
- **Smart Disabling** - Automatic infinite scroll disabling when all filtered exercises are displayed

### Comprehensive Test Coverage Implementation
- **AddExercise Component Tests** - Created comprehensive Vitest test suite with 12 tests covering skeleton loading, infinite scroll, search functionality, and accessibility
- **Exercise Component Test Enhancement** - Enhanced existing test file with 4 additional tests for infinite scroll behavior, screen reader announcements, and performance validation
- **Integration Flow Testing** - Developed ExerciseSelectionFlow.test.tsx testing complete workflow from empty workout state through exercise addition
- **Mobile E2E Testing** - Created Cypress mobile test suite with iPhone SE viewport (375x667) covering complete user journeys

### MSW Mock System for Future API Integration
- **Exercise API Handlers** - Comprehensive MSW setup with paginated exercise endpoints supporting search and muscle group filtering
- **Error Scenario Testing** - Server error handlers for robust test coverage and error handling validation
- **Performance Testing** - Network delay simulation (300ms) for realistic API response testing
- **Future-Ready Architecture** - Structured for seamless backend integration with minimal component changes

### Testing Architecture Excellence
- **Ionic Component Mocking** - Sophisticated mock system for IonSkeletonText, IonInfiniteScroll, and all Ionic components
- **Timer Management** - Proper fake timers with vi.useFakeTimers() for deterministic loading state testing
- **Event Simulation** - Complete CustomEvent mocking for infinite scroll trigger testing
- **Accessibility Testing** - Validated aria-labels, screen reader content, and keyboard navigation patterns

### Mobile-First Testing Strategy
- **Cypress Mobile Testing** - Realistic mobile viewport testing with touch interaction validation
- **Performance Metrics** - Loading time validation (< 3 seconds) and skeleton timing verification
- **Responsive Design Testing** - Button sizing (36px touch targets) and mobile layout validation
- **User Journey Coverage** - Complete workflows from dashboard through exercise selection to workout building

### Key Files Created/Enhanced
- **src/components/__tests__/AddExercise.test.tsx** - New comprehensive test suite with skeleton and infinite scroll coverage
- **src/pages/Exercise.test.tsx** - Enhanced with infinite scroll tests and screen reader announcement validation
- **src/__tests__/ExerciseSelectionFlow.test.tsx** - Integration test covering complete workout building workflow
- **cypress/e2e/exercise-selection-mobile.cy.ts** - Mobile E2E test with realistic user journeys and performance validation
- **src/__tests__/mocks/** - MSW setup with exercise API handlers for future backend integration

### Performance Benefits Achieved
- **Reduced Initial Render Time** - 20-item pagination prevents rendering large exercise lists simultaneously
- **Smooth User Experience** - Skeleton loading eliminates layout shifts and provides immediate visual feedback
- **Mobile Optimization** - Infinite scroll reduces memory usage on mobile devices with limited resources
- **Professional Polish** - Loading states match commercial fitness app standards with proper timing and animations

### Testing Coverage Metrics
- **Component Unit Tests**: 25+ test cases covering loading states, pagination, search, accessibility, and integration
- **E2E Mobile Testing**: Complete user journeys with mobile viewport and touch interaction validation
- **Performance Testing**: Loading time validation, skeleton timing, and infinite scroll behavior
- **Error Handling**: MSW error scenarios and component error boundary testing
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Screen reader testing, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attribute validation
