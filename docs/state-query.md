# State Management & Data Architecture

## Data Management

### Current Approach
- **Mock Data**: Static data structures for prototyping and development
- **Component State**: React hooks for local component state management
- **Props Drilling**: Simple prop passing for current scope

## Shared Type System

### TypeScript Interfaces
- **WorkoutSet**: Individual set data structure with reps, weight, completed status
- **WorkoutExercise**: Complete exercise data with sets array, muscle groups, and metadata
- **EditField**: Form field types for user input validation
- **SetEditingState**: State management for inline editing functionality

### Type Safety Implementation
- **Centralized Types**: `src/types/workout.ts` provides shared interfaces across components
- **Eliminated Any Types**: Replaced all generic `any[]` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Type Consistency**: Ensured consistent typing between ExerciseCard, Workout, and AddExercise components
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Established extensible type system for additional workout features

## Performance Optimization

### Component Optimization
- **React.memo Implementation**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed
- **Callback Memoization**: useCallback hooks for all event handlers
- **Optimized Dependencies**: Careful dependency array management to minimize callback recreation
- **Component Isolation**: Self-contained components that only re-render when data actually changes

### Data Management Patterns
- **Immutable State Updates**: Proper state management patterns for set completion and addition
- **Context-Based State**: RestTimerContext for workout pause state management
- **Props Architecture**: Clean prop passing with well-defined interfaces
- **State Encapsulation**: Components remain stateless, relying on parent for data handling

## Future Data Architecture

### Backend Integration Preparation
- **MSW Mock System**: Comprehensive API handlers for exercise endpoints with pagination
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Server error handlers for robust error handling validation
- **Performance Testing**: Network delay simulation for realistic API response testing
- **Future-Ready Architecture**: Structured for seamless backend integration with minimal changes

### State Management Evolution
- **Context API**: Expand context usage for global state (user data, workout sessions)
- **Local Storage**: Implement persistence for user preferences and offline data
- **Cache Management**: Optimize data caching strategies for offline-first experience
- **Real-time Updates**: Prepare architecture for live data synchronization
