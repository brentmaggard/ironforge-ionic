# Ionic React Audit Report

## Phase A: Routing

**Summary:** The application's routing is well-structured and adheres to established Ionic React (v5/v6) patterns. The setup is sound and leverages Ionic's navigation paradigms correctly.

**Findings:**

1.  **React Router Version:**
    *   **Status:** OK
    *   **Details:** A search for React Router v6 APIs (e.g., `useNavigate`, `<Routes>`) returned no results. The project correctly uses the `react-router-dom` v5 components (`<Route>`, `<Redirect>`) specified in its documentation.

2.  **Core Ionic Routing:**
    *   **Status:** OK
    *   **Details:** `src/App.tsx` correctly implements `<IonReactRouter>` as the top-level router. The main tab-based navigation is properly contained within an `<IonRouterOutlet>` inside an `<IonTabs>` component.

3.  **Overlays vs. Routes:**
    *   **Status:** OK
    *   **Details:** The application uses a standard and effective Ionic pattern for modal pages (`/profile`, `/edit-profile`, `/exercise`). By defining these `<Route>` components outside of the `<IonTabs>` structure, they correctly behave as overlays that cover the main tab interface. This matches the architecture described in the project's documentation.

**Conclusion:** No issues found. The routing architecture is robust and correctly implemented.
